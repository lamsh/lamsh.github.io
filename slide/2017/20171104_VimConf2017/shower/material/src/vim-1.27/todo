Bugs, VI compatibility:

Setting the size of the window does not always work as expected.
With quickfix we only get the first 25 errors. How do we get the rest?
The ":cq" command does not always abort the compiler.
When editing multiple files, typing :q twice should exit Vim.


Further extentions:

History stack for . command?
When there are "Too many files", possibility to insert them all (CTRL-A).
Use insert/delete char when terminal supports it.
"edit" option: when off changing the buffer is not possible.
Add "-d null" for editing with a script file without a display.
For MSDOS use memory mapped screen output (ansi.sys not needed).
For MSDOS search for _exrc in the directory where the binary is, instead
	of using $VIM\_exrc.
In insert mode: Remember the characters that were removed with backspace and
	re-insert them one at a time with CTRL-x, all together with CTRL-x.
Add possibility to set a keymap. The code in amiga.c does not work yet.
Add recognition of CR-LF files and correctly write them automatically.
Add to quoting: Center, right-adjust, left-adjust, function (e.g. add).
Add possibility to re-select previously quoted part.

From Elvis:
fontchanges recognized "\\fB" etc.
parse error messages from many compilers


Far future extentions:

Option verbose; when on keep the screen uptodate, when off only redisplay when
	input needed.
Remember message line for redraw.
Use disk swap file when editing very large files.
Mode to keep text formatted while inserting/deleting.
Mode to keep C-code formatted (sort of on-line indent)
Option to choose between line wrap and horizontal scrolling
