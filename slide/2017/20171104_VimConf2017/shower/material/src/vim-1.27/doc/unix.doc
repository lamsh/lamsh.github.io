This file contains the particularities for the UNIX version of Vim.

The default help filename is "/usr/local/doc/vim.hlp"
The files "$HOME/.vimrc" and "$HOME/.exrc" are used instead of "s:.vimrc" and 
"s:.exrc". Additionally "/usr/etc/.vimrc" is used first.

Temporary files (for filtering) are put in "/tmp".

In some rare cases the terminal may have a problem with CTRL-Q or CTRL-S. To 
get around this you can map another key to CTRL-Q and CTRL-S, and remap 
CTRL-Q and CTRL-S to nothing. You could use CTRL-W and CTRL-X:
	:noremap! ^W ^V017
	:noremap! ^X ^V019
	:noremap! ^V017 ^V^V
	:noremap! ^V019 ^V^V
	:noremap ^W ^V017
	:noremap ^X ^V019
	:noremap ^V017 ^V^V
	:noremap ^V019 ^V^V
(^V is the single character CTRL-V. Do not use the '^' character. You have to 
type CTRL-V twice to get one. What is shown above is what you have to type, 
it will look different on the screen or in the .exrc file.)

With wildcard expansion you can use <~> (home directory) and <$> 
(environment variable).

If terminal updating is slow, try resetting the 'showcommand' and the 
'ruler' option (e.g. in a shell window in suntools).

The file Vim132 is a shell script that can be used to put Vim in 132 column 
mode on a vt100 and lookalikes.

The *.info files are for the Amiga. You don't need them with unix.
