This file contains the particularities for the MSDOS version of Vim.

If Vim produces all kinds of garbage on the screen you need to install
ansi.sys (or equivalent).

If the "tx" (textmode) option is set (which is the default), Vim will accept a 
single <LF> or a <CR><LF> pair for end-of-line. When writing a file Vim will 
use <CR><LF>. Thus if you edit a file and write it, <LF> is replaced with 
<CR><LF>. Single <CR> characters are lost. If the "tx" option is not set the 
single <LF> will be used for end-of-line. A <CR> will be shown as ^M.
You can use Vim to replace <LF> by <CR><LF> by reading in any mode and 
writing in text mode. You can use Vim to replace <CR><LF> by <LF> by reading 
in text mode and writing in non-text mode.

Script files contain single <CR> characters. If you want to edit a script file 
you should reset the textmode option before loading the file.

The default help filename is "$VIM\vim.hlp". If the environment variable $VIM 
is not defined or the file is not found, the DOS search path is used to 
search for the file "vim.hlp". If you do not want to put "vim.hlp" in your 
search path, use the command ":set helpfile=pathname" to tell Vim where the 
help file is.

The files "_vimrc" and "_exrc" are used instead of ".vimrc" and ".exrc".
The files "$VIM\_vimrc" and "$VIM\_exrc" are used instead of "s:.vimrc" and 
"s:.exrc".

Use CTRL-break instead of CTRL-C to interrupt searches. The CTRL-C is not
detected until a key is read.

Use CTRL-arrow-left and CTRL-arrow-right instead of SHIFT-arrow-left and 
SHIFT-arrow-right. The arrow-up and arrow-down cannot be used with SHIFT or 
CTRL.

Temporary files (for filtering) are put in the current directory.

The default for the sh (shell) option is "command". External commands are 
started with "command /c <command_name>". Typing CTRL-Z starts a new command 
shell. Return to Vim with "exit".


MS-DOS allows for only one filename extention. Therefore, in the original 
filename the '.' is replaced by a '_', the name is truncated to 8 characters 
and the new extention ".vim" or ".bak" is appended. Two examples: "test.c" 
becomes "test_c.bak", "ditiseen.tst" becomes "ditiseen.bak". The 'shortname' 
option is not available.

The MS-DOS binary was compiled with Turbo-C version 2.0 (yes, it's old). You 
may get some "argument never used" warning messages. They can be ignored. If 
you get all kinds of strange error messages when compiling, you have to add 
<CR> characters at the end of each line. This can be done with the addcr 
program: "make addcr". This will compile addcr.c to addcr.exe and execute 
the addcr.bat file.

All text is kept in memory. This limits the size of the file you can edit,
the number of undo levels that can be remembered, etc.. If Vim gives an "Out 
of memory" warning you should stop editing. Result of further editing actions 
is unpredictable.

The *.info files are for the Amiga. You don't need them with MSDOS.
