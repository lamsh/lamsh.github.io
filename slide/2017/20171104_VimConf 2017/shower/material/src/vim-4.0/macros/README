The macros in the maze, hanoi and urm directories can be used to test Vim for
vi compatibility.  They have been written for vi to show its unlimited
possibilities.

hanoi	Macros that solve the tower of hanoi problem.
maze	Macros that solve a maze (amazing!).
urm	Macros that simulate a simple computer: "Universal Register Machine"

They are unmodified.

dvorak:	    for when you use a Dvorak keyboard
html:	    macros for editing HTML files
rot13:	    code/decode the buffer for rot13
shell.gui:  menus for editing shell scripts in the GUI version
swapmous:   swap left and right mouse buttons
